# Google Analytics Vimeo Video Tracking for Universal Analytics (analytics.js)
Tracking Vimeo Player Events with Google Analytics for Universal Analytics (analytics.js). This is based off <a href="http://github.com/sanderheilbron/vimeo.ga.js">sanderheilbron/vimeo.ga.js</a>.

## Usage
Include the scripts in the body section of the HTML document, just before the `</body>` tag. Youâ€™ll need to be running on a web server instead of opening the file directly in your browser. Flash and JS security restrictions will prevent the API from working when run locally.

### Basic
```html
<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/22439234?api=1" width="640" height="390" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>
<script src='https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.3/jquery.min.js'></script>
<script src="path/to/vimeo.ga.min.js"></script>
```	
### With some options
```html
<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/22439234?api=1" width="640" height="390" frameborder="0" data-progress="true" data-seek="true" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>
<script src='https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.3/jquery.min.js'></script>
<script src="path/to/vimeo.ga.min.js"></script>
```
The **data-progress** and **data-seek** attributes enable tracking of progress and skip events. 

The iframe embeds a Vimeo video player and allows Vimeo to serve an HTML5 player rather than a Flash player for mobile devices that do not support Flash.

## Requirements
* jQuery 1.4.3 or higher
* Google Analytics Tracking Code (asynchronous)
* The end user must be using a browser that supports the HTML5 postMessage feature. Most modern browsers support postMessage, though Internet Explorer 7 does not support it.

## Browser Support
Tested in Chrome (21), Firefox (15), Safari (5,6), IE (8,9). Also tested on iOS.

## Event Tracking
All player events are only tracked once. Restarting the video will not reset the event trackers.

### Default event trackers
* Category: Vimeo
* Action:
	* **Started video**: when the video starts playing.
	* **Paused video**: when the video is paused.
	* **Completed video**: when the video reaches 100% completion.
* Label: URL of embedded video on Vimeo.

#####Example
```js
ga('send', 'event', 'Vimeo', 'Started video', 'http://player.vimeo.com/video/22439234', undefined, true);
ga('send', 'event', 'Vimeo', 'Paused video', 'http://player.vimeo.com/video/22439234', undefined, true);
ga('send', 'event', 'Vimeo', 'Completed video', 'http://player.vimeo.com/video/22439234', undefined, true);
```
### Progress event trackers

* Category: Vimeo
* Action:
	* **25% Progress**: when the video reaches 25% of the total video time.
	* **50% Progress**: when the video reaches 50% of the total video time.
	* **75% Progress**: when the video reaches 75% of the total video time.
* Label: URL of embedded video on Vimeo.

#####Example
```js
ga('send', 'event', 'Vimeo', 'Played video: 25%', 'http://player.vimeo.com/video/22439234', undefined, true);
ga('send', 'event', 'Vimeo', 'Played video: 50%', 'http://player.vimeo.com/video/22439234', undefined, true);
ga('send', 'event', 'Vimeo', 'Played video: 75%', 'http://player.vimeo.com/video/22439234', undefined, true);
```
### Seek event tracker
* Category: Vimeo
* Action:
	* **Skipped video**: when the video is skipped forward or backward.
* Label: URL of embedded video on Vimeo.

#####Example
```js
ga('send', 'event', 'Vimeo', 'Skipped video forward or backward', 'http://player.vimeo.com/video/22439234', undefined, true);
```

### Bounce rate
The event trackers do not impact bounce rate of the page which embeds the video. The value of the opt_noninteraction parameter is set to `true`.
